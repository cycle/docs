# Belongs To
Belongs To relation defines that an entity is owned by a related entity on the exclusive matter. Example: a post belongs to an author, a comment belongs a post. Most `belongsTo` relations can be created using the `inverse` option of the declared `hasOne` or `hasMany` relation.

> The entity will be always persisted after its related entity.

## Definition
To define Belongs To relation using annotated entities extension use:

```php
/** @Entity */
class Post
{
    // ...

    /** @BelongsTo(target = "User") */
    protected $user;
}
```

> You must properly handle the cases when the relation is not initialized (`null`)!

By default, the ORM will generate an outer key in the relation object using the related entity's role and outer key (primary key by default) values. As result column and FK will be added to Post entity on `user_id` column.

Option      | Value  | Comment
---         | ---    | ----
load        | lazy/eager | Relation load approach. Defaults to `lazy`
cascade     | bool   | Automatically save related data with source entity. Defaults to `true`
nullable    | bool   | Defines if the relation can be nullable (child can have no parent). Defaults to `false`
innerKey    | string | Inner key in source entity. Defaults to `{relationName}_{outerKey}`
outerKey    | string | Outer key in the related entity. Defaults to the primary key
fkCreate    | bool   | Set to true to automatically create FK on innerKey. Defaults to `true`
fkAction    | CASCADE, NO ACTION, SET NULL | FK onDelete and onUpdate action. Defaults to `CASCADE`
indexCreate | bool   | Create an index on innerKey. Defaults to `true`

## Usage
Cycle will automatically save the related entity (unless `cascade` set to `false`).

```php
$post = new Post();
$post->setUser(new User("Antony"));

$t = new \Cycle\ORM\Transaction($orm);
$t->persist($post);
$t->run();
```

You can only de-associate the related entity if the relation is defined as `nullable`. In other scenarios you will get an integrity exception:

```php
$post = $orm->getRepository(Post::class)->findOne();

$post->setUser(null);

$t = new \Cycle\ORM\Transaction($orm);
$t->persist($post);
$t->run();
```

### Loading
To access related data simply call the method `load` of your `Post` `Select` object:

```php
$p = $orm->getRepository(Post::class)->select()->load('user')->wherePK(1)->fetchOne();
print_r($p->getAddress());
```

### Filtering
You can filter entity selection using related data, call the method `with` of your entity's `Select` to join the related entity table:

```php
$posts = $orm->getRepository(Post::class)
    ->select()
    ->with('user')->where('user.status', 'active')
    ->fetchAll();

print_r($posts);
```

`Select` can automatically join related tables on the first `where` condition. The previous example can be rewritten:

```php
$posts = $orm->getRepository(Post::class)
    ->select()
    ->where('user.status', 'active')
    ->fetchAll();

print_r($posts);
```
