# Limitations
The current implementation of Cycle ORM includes multiple limitations.

## Compound Primary Keys
ORM relies on a unique primary key to create a proper entity map, using complex primary keys is currently not implemented.

See https://github.com/cycle/orm/issues/22

## Filter by relations from external databases
It is currently not possible to automatically filter the selection based on values of related entities located in an external source.
You must manually filter the selected result after loading all the data. Though, it is possible to use `fetchData` of
`Cycle\ORM\Select` to avoid entity instantiation before the filtering.

Since you can provide any iterable source to the `Cycle\ORM\Iterator` you can create nested generator:

```php
use Cycle\ORM;

function filterByExternal(ORM\Select $select, $value)
{
    foreach($select->load('external')->fetchData() as $item) {
        if ($line['external']['value'] == $item) {
            yield $item;
        }
    }
}

// ...

foreach (new ORM\Iterator($orm, User::class, filterByExternal($select, $value)) as $user) {
    print_r($user);
}
```

> The given approach will minimize the amount of allocated memory.

You can also use the `load` option of `Select->load` to pre-filter data.

## MyISAM
It is not reliable to use Cycle with MySQL MyISAM engine as it does not support transactions, which can guarantee the recovery from persisting errors. Use the InnoDB engine instead.

## Cascade = false
Please note that turning cascade option off completely disables relation `store` sequence. This makes uni-directional relations useless for **persisting**, only use this option if the relation is considered "read-only".
