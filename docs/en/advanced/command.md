# Commands and Linked Contexts
All of the persist operations are performed using a set of linked commands. Commands are responsible for execution, rollback and change commitment. A command can depend on values provided by entity state or another command (link).

## Command Interface
To understand how commands work let's review the underlying interface first:

```php
interface CommandInterface
{
    /**
     * Must return true when the command is ready for the execution. UnitOfWork will throw
     * an exception if any of the commands are stuck in non ready state.
     *
     * @return bool
     */
    public function isReady(): bool;

    /**
     * Indicates that the command has been executed.
     *
     * @return bool
     */
    public function isExecuted(): bool;

    /**
     * Executes the command.
     */
    public function execute();

    /**
     * Complete command, method to be called when all other commands are already executed and
     * transaction is closed.
     */
    public function complete();

    /**
     * Rollback command or declare that the command has been rolled back.
     */
    public function rollBack();
}
```

One of the most important methods in commands is `isReady`. This method is used by Transaction to properly sort the dependency graph in order
to execute commands in the most optimal order.

## Linked Commands
We can review a simple command setup in which one command declares a column which depends on lastInsertID provided by another command:

```php
use Cycle\ORM\Command\Database;

$update = new Database\Update($dbal->database('default'), 'table', $data, $where);
$insert = new Database\Insert($dbal->database('default'), 'table', $data);
```

Now we have to declare for the `$update` command to wait for the context provided by `$insert`:

```php
// command would be not ready until the context is provided
$update->waitContext('some_id');
```

And ask `$insert` command to forward context value once it's available:

```php
$insert->forward(\Cycle\ORM\Command\Database\Insert::INSERT_ID, $update, 'some_id');
```

Now, no matter what in which order commands were added to the Transaction the `$update` will always be executed after the `$insert` command.

## Joining Commands in Mappers
If you want to implement and issue custom commands you must pick a place where to create them. You can do this inside a custom relation `queue` method or alter one of the methods of entity mappers.

Since you can only issue one command from your mapper you can use `Sequence` or `ContextSequence` to merge commands together:

> CommandSequence automatically forwards link requests to the primary command.

```php
use Cycle\ORM\Command;
use Cycle\ORM\Heap;

// ...

public function queueCreate($entity, Heap\Node $node, Heap\State $state): Command\ContextCarrierInterface
{
    $cc = parent::queueCreate($entity, $node, $state);

    $cs = new Command\Branch\ContextSequence();
    $cs->addPrimary($cc);
    $cs->addCommand(new CustomCommand());

    return $cs;
}
```

## Command Topology
Besides sequences, you also have multiple system commands which can be used to create more complex execution trees.

#### Nil Command
You can use the Nil command to state that no changes must be made:

```php
use Cycle\ORM\Command;
use Cycle\ORM\Heap;

// ...

public function queueCreate($entity, Heap\Node $node, Heap\State $state): Command\ContextCarrierInterface
{
    // disable create
    return new Command\Branch\Nil();
}
```

#### Condition Command
In some cases you might want to execute a command or a branch of commands using some external condition. You can use the `Condition` command for this purpose:

```php
use Cycle\ORM\Command;
use Cycle\ORM\Heap;

// ...

public function queueCreate($entity, Heap\Node $node, Heap\State $state): Command\ContextCarrierInterface
{
    $cc = parent::queueCreate($entity, $node, $state);

    return new Command\Branch\Condition($cc, function() {
        return mt_rand(0, 1) === 1; // randomly drop some commands, don't do it.
    });
}
```

You can link these conditions to the entity state or node to implement more complex logic.

> Make sure to use entity State, not Node, as a condition variable as State will change during the execution while Node will not.

## Split command
Another internal command which is applied by the ORM by default is `Split`. The command is used in order to resolve cyclic dependencies by splitting the persistence of the object into Insert and Update.
