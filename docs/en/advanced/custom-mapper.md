# Custom Mapper
You can alter any of the command(s) generated by the ORM mappers by replacing it with your own implementation. Another option is to create your own commands and link them to the `update`, `insert` or `delete`.

## Hook into Insert/Update/Delete command
To add your own handler when an entity is created, updated or deleted modify the methods `queueCreate`, `queueUpdate` and `queueDelete` of
your entity wrapper.

```php
use Cycle\ORM\Command\ContextCarrierInterface;
use Cycle\ORM\Mapper\Mapper;
use Cycle\ORM\Heap\Node;

class MyMapper extends Mapper
{
    public function queueCreate($entity, Node $node, State $state): ContextCarrierInterface
    {
        $cmd = parent::queueCreate($entity, $node, $state);
        
        // do something
        
        return $cmd;
    }

    public function queueUpdate($entity, Node $node, State $state): ContextCarrierInterface
    {
        $cmd = parent::queueUpdate($entity, $node, $state);
        
        // do something
        
        return $cmd;
    }
```

And assign the entity to the specific mapper:

```php
/**
 * @Entity(mapper="MyMapper")
 */
class User
{
   //...
}
```

## Command Chain
We can link another command to be executed right after `$cmd`:

```php
use Cycle\ORM\Command;
use Cycle\ORM\Heap;

public function queueCreate($entity, Heap\Node $node, Heap\State $state): Command\ContextCarrierInterface
{
    $cmd = parent::queueCreate($entity, $node, $state);

    $cs = new Command\Branch\ContextSequence();
    $cs->addPrimary($cmd);
    $cs->addCommand(new OurCommand());

    return $cs;
}
```

In case of Create, the primary key sequence won't be available at the moment of `queueCreate` call (it will be available after `SQL INSERT` query).

This value must be forwarded to our command using `forward` method from `$cmd`:

```php
use Cycle\ORM\Commande;
use Cycle\ORM\Heap;
use Cycle\ORM\Command\Database\Insert;

public function queueCreate($entity, Heap\Node $node, Heap\State $state): Commande\ContextCarrierInterface
{
    $cmd = parent::queueCreate($entity, $node, $state);
    $our = new OurCommand();

    // wait for cmd_id value or fail
    $our->waitContext('cmd_id', true);

    // send lastID value as cmd_id to $our command
    $cmd->forward(Insert::INSERT_ID, $our, 'cmd_id');

    $cs = new Command\Branch\ContextSequence();
    $cs->addPrimary($cmd);
    $cs->addCommand($our);

    return $cs;
}
```

> Example: see [sample implementation](https://github.com/cycle/orm/blob/master/tests/ORM/Fixtures/UserSnapshotMapper.php) which copies all entity changes into a separate table.

## Autoconfiguration
ORM schema provides one reserved Entity constant `SCHEMA` which can be used to specify custom Mapper behavior. You can combine schema-builder and custom mapper implementation to create configurable mappers.

> Cycle does not provide such mapper implementations (a.k.a. "behaviors") out of the box, feel free to suggest your implementation as an extension.
