# Entity manager (Unit of Work)

Every persist operation for an entity must be performed via the Entity manager object. This object will rely on `Heap`
associated with the given ORM and will request each entity mapper and relation to issue a set of persist commands in the
form of a command chain.

> All transactions are treated as disposable, you can create and delete them as you need.

## EntityManagerInterface

ORM provides a convenient class to manage transactions, however, it is recommended to couple your code with an
underlying interface for the simplicity and easier testing going forward:

```php
interface EntityManagerInterface
{
    /**
     * Tells the EntityManager to make an Entity managed and persistent.
     *
     * Entity will be queued up with fixing current state.
     * Entity state changes after adding to the queue will be ignored.
     *
     * Note: The entity will be updated or inserted into the database at transaction
     * run or as a result of the run operation.
     */
    public function persistState(object $entity, bool $cascade = true): self;

    /**
     * Tells the EntityManager to make an Entity managed and persistent with deferred state syncing.
     *
     * Entity will be queued up without fixing current state.
     * Entity state changes will be synced with queued state during run operation.
     *
     * Note: The entity will be updated or inserted into the database at transaction
     * run or as a result of the run operation.
     */
    public function persist(object $entity, bool $cascade = true): self;

    /**
     * Delete an entity.
     *
     * Note: A deleted entity will be removed from the database at transaction
     * run or as a result of the run operation.
     */
    public function delete(object $entity, bool $cascade = true): self;

    /**
     * Sync all changes to entities that have been added to the queue with database.
     *
     * Synchronizes the in-memory state of managed entities with the database.
     */
    public function run(): \Cycle\ORM\Transaction\StateInterface;

    /**
     * Clean state.
     */
    public function clean(): static;
}
```

## Example Usage

To persist your entity simply add it to the entity manager using the `persist` method and call the method `run` after
that.

```php
$manager = new \Cycle\ORM\EntityManager($orm);
$manager->persist($entity);
$manager->run();
```

> Do not forget to handle `Cycle\Database\Exception\DatabaseException`.

```php
$manager = new \Cycle\ORM\EntityManager($orm);
$manager->persist($entity);
try {
    $manager->run();
} catch (\Cycle\Database\Exception\StatementException\ConnectionException $e) {
    $logger->error($e->getMessage());
}
```

Or you can return transaction state and handle errors via it:

```php
$manager = new \Cycle\ORM\EntityManager($orm);
$manager->persist($entity);
$state = $manager->run(throwException: false);

while ($error = $state->getLastError()) {
    if ($error instanceof \Cycle\Database\Exception\StatementException\ConnectionException) {
        usleep(100);
        $state->retry();
        continue;
    }
    
    throw $error;
}
```

You can handle multiple entity managers within one scope. They can overlap or be responsible for separate entities:

```php
$manager = new \Cycle\ORM\EntityManager($orm);
$manager->persist($e);
$manager->run();

$manager2 = new \Cycle\ORM\EntityManager($orm);
$manager2->persist($e2);
$manager2->run();
```

After execution the Entity manager will be cleared and can be re-used for the next batch of commands. Please note, ORM
Heap would not be reset after the transaction, you must clean it manually if needed.

```php
$manager = new \Cycle\ORM\EntityManager($orm);

for ($i=0; $i<1000; $i++) {
    $manager->persist($e);
    $manager->run();
}

$orm->getHeap()->clean();
// or
$manager->clean(cleanHeap: true);
```

## Persist state

There are two methods to persist an Entity.

#### `persist`

In this case the entity will be queued up without fixing current state and all the next Entity changes will affect the 
Entity state inside Entity manager.

```php
$manager = new \Cycle\ORM\EntityManager($orm);


$user = new User();
$user->name = 'Antony';
$manager->persist($entity);
$user->name = 'John';

$manager->run();

// insert into users (name) values ('John')
```

#### `persistState`

In this case the entity will be queued up with fixing current state and all thr next Entity changes won't affect the
Entity state inside Entity manager.

```php
$manager = new \Cycle\ORM\EntityManager($orm);


$user = new User();
$user->name = 'Antony';
$manager->persistState($entity);
$user->name = 'John';

$manager->run();

// insert into users (name) values ('Antony')
```


## Cascade persisting

By default, EntityManager will create a command chain to store all entity relations unless the opposite is specified in
the relation schema. If you would like to store only entity content without it's relations use the persist named
argument `cascade`:

```php
$manager = new \Cycle\ORM\EntityManager($orm);
$manager->persist($entity, cascade: false);
$manager->run();
```

## Entity manager runner

In some cases, you might want to implement your own persist logic or sorting for issued commands. You can create your
own Entity manager implementation or provide the second argument to the transaction to handle actual command execution:

```php
use Cycle\ORM\Command\CommandInterface;

interface RunnerInterface extends \Countable
{
    public function run(CommandInterface $command): void;

    /**
     * Complete/commit all executed changes. Must clean the state of the runner.
     */
    public function complete(): void;

    /**
     * Rollback all executed changes. Must clean the state of the runner.
     */
    public function rollback(): void;
}
```

For example, we can log the order of which commands are being executed by wrapping the original transaction Runner:

```php
use Cycle\ORM\Command\CommandInterface;

class LogRunner implements RunnerInterface
{
    private RunnerInterface $runner;

    public function __construct(
        private LoggerInterface $logger
    ) {
        $this->runner = new \Cycle\ORM\Transaction\Runner();
    }

    public function run(CommandInterface $command): void
    {
        $this->logger->debug($command);
        
        $this->runner->run($command);
    }

    public function complete(): void
    {
        $this->runner->complete();
    }

    public function rollback(): void
    {
        $this->runner->rollback();
    }
}
```

To use it:

```php
$manager = new \Cycle\ORM\EntityManager($orm, new LogRunner());
$manager->persist($entity);
$manager->run();
```

## Reusing same Entity manager

The Entity manager is clean after the `run` invocation. You must assemble a new transaction to retry the same set of
entities. Since the Entity manager is clean you are able to reuse it over and over again (make sure to keep `persist`
, `delete` and `run` operations within one method).

## Entity manager transactions level

Method `run` wraps all commands into one Database transaction and tries to commit it. In some cases there is a need not
use a new transaction level and run commands onside current transaction or don't use transaction at all.

#### Inside current transaction

If transaction of any used driver wasn't opened the Runner will throw an Exception and stop Unit of Work.

```php
$driver->beginTransaction();

$manager = new \Cycle\ORM\EntityManager($orm);

try {
    $driver->execute('update users set name = "John Smith" where id = 1');
    
    $manager->persist($entity);
    $manager->persist($entity2);
    $manager->delete($entity3);
    
    $manager->run(runner: \Cycle\ORM\Transaction\Runner::outerTransaction());

    $driver->commitTransaction();
} catch (\Throwable) {
    $driver->rollbackTransaction();
}
```

#### Without transaction

When strict mode is `false` the Runner won't begin/commit/rollback transactions and will ignore any transaction 
statuses.

```php
$manager = new \Cycle\ORM\EntityManager($orm);

$driver->execute('update users set name = "John Smith" where id = 1');

$manager->persist($entity);
$manager->persist($entity2);
$manager->delete($entity3);

$manager->run(runner: \Cycle\ORM\Transaction\Runner::outerTransaction(strict: false));
```
