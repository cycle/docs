# Select Entity
Cycle ORM provides multiple options to select entity data from the database.
The most common and recommended method to use the associated entity repository.

## Using Repository
To access the repository associated with a specific entity use the method `getRepository` of the orm service:

```php
$repository = $orm->getRepository(User::class);
```

You can request a repository instance using the entity's class name or its role name:

```php
$repository = $orm->getRepository("user");
```

The Repository provides multiple methods to select the entity.

To find the entity using its primary key:

```php
$entity = $repository->findByPK(1);
```

> Note, the method will return `null` if no entity is found.

To find an entity by any of its field(s) use:

```php
$entity = $repository->findOne([
  'name' => 'Antony'
]);
```

> Field names will be automatically mapped to appropriate column names.

You can use any amount of fields in a request:

```php
$entity = $repository->findOne([
  'name'    => 'Antony',
  'balance' => 100
]);
```

If your repository is an instance of `Cycle\ORM\Select\Repository` (SQL) you can also use combined expressions:

```php
$entity = $repository->findOne([
  'name'    => 'Antony',
  'balance' => ['>=' => 100]
]);
```

> You can read more about compound expressions [here](/docs/en/query-builder/complex.md).

To find multiple entities use:

```php
foreach($repository->findAll(['status' => 'active']) as $e) {
  // ...
}
```

## Working with SelectQuery
If the repository entity is an instance of `Cycle\ORM\Select\Repository` (default SQL repository) you can also access
the low level method `select`, which grants you the ability to construct more complex queries or pre-load related entities:

```php
$result = $repository->select()->where('balance', '>', 1)->load('address')->fetchAll();
```

> It's recommended to avoid usage of `select` method outside of repository classes and instead expose [custom](/docs/en/basic/repository.md) find methods.

> You can read more about the methods available in select queries [here](/docs/en/database/query-builders.md).

## The repository Scope
Please note, in Cycle ORM the Repository object is only responsible for entity retrieval. All persist operations must be handled by transactions, entity mappers and command chains.
